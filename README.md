Kanban Task Management System Design Document
## 1. Introduction
This document describes the system architecture for a Kanban-style task management application. The application will support third-party authentication using Supabase and will utilize MongoDB Atlas for data storage. The front-end and back-end services will be developed using Nuxt 3.

## 2. System Components
# 2.1 Front-End
Framework: Nuxt 3
Features:
User authentication via Supabase (third-party login).
Board, list, and task creation.
Drag-and-drop functionality for tasks.
Real-time board and task updates.
# 2.2 Back-End
Framework: Nuxt 3 (server-side)
Features:
API endpoints for CRUD operations on boards, lists, and tasks.
Authentication and authorization middleware.
Integration with MongoDB Atlas for data storage.
# 2.3 Database
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Schemas:
User:
UserID
Email
AuthToken (from Supabase)
Boards (array of BoardIDs)
Board:
BoardID
Name
Lists (array of ListIDs)
Owner (UserID)
List:
ListID
Name
Tasks (array of TaskIDs)
Task:
TaskID
Name
Description
Status (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done)
# 2.4 Authentication
Provider: Supabase
Features:
Third-party login support (e.g., Google, GitHub).
Generation of JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.
Middleware for validating JWT tokens and securing API endpoints.
## 3. System Workflow
User Authentication:

The user logs in via a third-party provider using Supabase.
On successful authentication, Supabase returns a JWT token.
The token is stored client-side for authenticated sessions and is passed to the server for authenticated requests.
Board Operations:

Users can create boards, which are then stored in MongoDB Atlas.
Each board can have multiple lists, and each list can have multiple tasks.
Task Management:

Users can add, edit, or delete tasks within a list.
Tasks can be dragged and dropped between lists, updating their status.
All task operations are stored and retrieved from MongoDB Atlas.
## 4. Scalability and Performance
Database Scaling: MongoDB Atlas supports horizontal scaling through sharding, ensuring the application remains performant as data grows.
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to speed up frequent data retrieval operations, possibly using Redis or a similar caching solution.
CDN: Use a Content Delivery Network for serving static assets to reduce load times for global users.
## 5. Security Considerations
Data Encryption: Ensure data at rest and in transit is encrypted.
Input Validation: Implement server-side input validation to protect against malicious input.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on the API to prevent abuse.
## 6. Future Enhancements
Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert users about task updates.
Collaboration: Add features for users to collaborate on boards in real-time.

## Kanban Task Management System Architecture
#User Interface (UI)
Represents the frontend built with Nuxt 3.
Connects to the backend API for data operations.
Connects to Supabase for user authentication.

#Backend API (Nuxt 3 Server)
Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on boards, lists, and tasks.
Connects to MongoDB Atlas for data storage.
Authenticates requests using JWT tokens from Supabase.

#Supabase
Handles third-party user authentication.
Generates JWT tokens for user sessions.
Connected to by both the frontend for login and the backend for token verification.

#MongoDB Atlas
Stores user data, boards, lists, and tasks.
Communicates directly with the backend API.







# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview
```
